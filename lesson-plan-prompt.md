## FAQ's and Troubleshooting Tips
### Frequently Asked Questions
1.	What if the machines just won’t fly?
Biggest culprit - not allowing the propeller to build momentum and lift prior to launching.  Try adjusting the timing of the release using the “tick-tock” technique.  Second biggest culprit - just not enough stored potential energy.  Have learners turn the propeller until they can see many bumps in the rubber band. 

2.	It seems that this is for young learners. How can I adapt this project for older students?
Incorporate the iterative design process using different wing and fuselage designs, as outlined in the Flying Machines Extension document and explore how each iteration impacts flight.  Older learners are all for testing and repeating, instead of one and done!

3.	Is this project reusable/extendable?
Yes! By using masking tape to attach different wing designs, learners can iterate on their designs without damaging the core fuselage, enabling a deeper exploration of the engineering design process.  Each learner will keep their flying machine - so it’s a perfect “make-and-take” activity for further playful engineering at home. 

4.	How do I facilitate the engineering design process in this activity?
Use the wing evolution worksheet to guide learners through an iterative process: draw a wing design, test it, analyze the results, and make improvements. This allows students to practice critical thinking and refine their flying machines using the EDP.


### Troubleshooting Guide
If the flying machine flies down instead of up or away, change the direction of rotation - it needs to turn clockwise to fly forward / up!
•	 Ensure the rubber band is wound tightly enough (at least 70 twists, but 100 is better!)
•	For improved flight, experiment with the “tick-tock” technique to master propeller momentum before full release.
•	Pro Tip: Remind students to focus on iterative testing and peer feedback.

## Early Finisher / Post-Build Exploration
- Extension Activities
- Have learners experiment with new wing shapes, combining multiple designs to observe different flight patterns. Use prompts like, “What happens if we make the wings larger?” to spark curiosity.  Encourage students to disassemble their flying machines and rebuild them using new designs, emphasizing the iterative nature of engineering.

# Assessment Guide

Sample Assessment: Grade-Level Exit Tickets for Flying Machines Spark
Objective:
Develop reflective, grade-level-appropriate "exit ticket" questions for the Flying Machines Spark activity. These questions will encourage learners to reflect on their experience, apply critical thinking, and connect their activity to STEM concepts such as forces, motion, and the engineering design process.

Audience:
Learners: Kindergarten through Middle School
Educators: Teachers and facilitators guiding learners through hands-on STEM activities

Context:
The Flying Machines Spark involves learners building simple flying devices and testing them. The exit tickets will serve as a quick assessment tool, prompting reflection on what learners observed and how they might improve their designs.

Guidelines for Exit Ticket Questions:
Relevance: Questions must connect directly to the activity (e.g., how their flying machine performed).
Age-Appropriateness: Use language and concepts suitable for each developmental stage.
Reflective: Encourage learners to think about what they learned, noticed, or can improve.
Scaffolded Thinking: Progress from simple observations (younger learners) to more complex analysis and application (older learners).

Prompts for AI Chatbot:
