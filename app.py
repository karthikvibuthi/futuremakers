This project takes a minimum of 10 minutes, if at an event activity station, 30 minutes in a single classroom session, or up to 60 minutes if you use our recommended extensions.  Please refer to the full guide for details.\n  \n\nWhat’s in the kit?\n* Propeller\n* Two craft sticks\n* A latex-free rubber band\n* A card stock rectangle\n* Sticky strips\n* An instruction sheet\n\n\nAre any extra materials needed? \nYes! Students will need access to scissors and markers to design and create a fuselage for their flying machine.  You may want to make additional scrap or construction paper available if they want to make an alternate “wing”.\n\n\nHow can I lead my students with confidence?\nThese slide decks prepare you to communicate the big ideas and pro tips for activating the materials. \n\n\nSlides - English:Flying Machines\nSlides - Spanish: Flying Machines - ESP\n\nFlying Machines Kit - Learner No-Text Instructions:\nFlying Machines.pdf This one-page visual guide summarizes the basic build.\n\n\nBuild Your Confidence - Make a Flying Machine!\nEducators are most confident and successful when they build an example before using it with learners.  You’ll need about fifteen minutes to tackle this activity, and those will be minutes that you’ll thank yourself for taking later.  By investing in practice you’ll learn how the project connects to your learning objectives,  some challenges to anticipate, and develop your own pro tips to help learners know where to start based on what challenged you. \n\n\nHere’s a text overview of the build process to help you get started.  We encourage you to use the Flying Machines slide deck as well to help with the build process. \n\n1.        Gather Materials:\nReview the Spark components: 2 craft sticks, sticky foam strips, a paper clip, a propeller, a latex-free rubber band, and cardstock. You’ll need to supply scissors and drawing materials.\n\n\n2.        Start with Sticks:\nAlign the craft sticks at the center and secure them using two sticky foam strips. The foam wraps tightly around the overlap to form the main body (fuselage) of the flying machine.\n        \n3.        Create the Engine Hook:\nBend the paper clip into an “L” shape. Attach it to one end of the fuselage using another foam strip. This will serve as the hook for the rubber band, acting as the engine of the flying machine.\n\n\n4.        Attach Your Propeller:\nOn the opposite end of the fuselage, attach the propeller securely. This step forms the flying machine’s propulsion system.\n\n\n5.        Add the Wing:\nUsing the cardstock, encourage learners to draw, cut, and attach a wing to the fuselage. Highlight that larger wings might add weight, affecting flight. Pro Tip: Test different wing shapes and sizes to explore aerodynamics.  \n        \n6.        Connect the Rubber Band:\nHook one end of the rubber band to the paper clip and the other to the small hook on the propeller. This can be challenging, so encourage patience. Pro Tip: Twist the propeller clockwise multiple times to tighten the rubber band, storing elastic potential energy.  You may need to review the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise. \n        \n7.        Prepare for Launch:\nDemonstrate the “tick-tock technique” to allow the propeller to generate momentum and lift prior to launching your flying machine. It’s a quick maneuver, and takes as long as it does to say “tick-tock”! With one hand on the propeller and the other holding near the paperclip, release the propeller (“tick”) to let it spin very briefly - then lightly launch the fuselage (“tock”).  This takes practice, and many attempts will be required to get great results - and this is all about practicing technique.  Lots of spins of the propeller will be used up practicing - but don’t be discouraged!  By practicing the tick-tock technique, learners will be more successful in allowing the propeller to spin up prior to flight, like a real flying machine!\n\n\n8.        Test and Iterate:\nHave learners test their flying machines in a safe, open area. Encourage them to tweak wing shapes, sizes, and number of rubber band twists to observe different flight outcomes.  Use our Flying Machines Extension document and its printable wing evolution worksheet to support the testing and iteration.\n\n\n\n\nFacilitate With Confidence\nClassroom Planning\nThis is a 30 minute activity, and can be extended with the use of our extension plan. Organize your workspaces with access to additional paper, tape, scissors and drawing materials if possible. Encourage experimentation by supplying extra cardstock for wing modifications.  \nFacilitation Tips\nReinforce the importance of letting learners take ownership of their designs, offering support without leading. Use open-ended questions to guide learners through troubleshooting, fostering a student-centered, inquiry-driven environment.\n- Promote student-led inquiry: ask learners how they might modify their wings for better flight or what changes to the rubber band tension could do. \n- Teach SEL skills by emphasizing perseverance and teamwork, especially during the “tick-tock” testing phase.\n\n\nFAQ’s\n1.        What if the machines just won’t fly?\nBiggest culprit - not allowing the propeller to build momentum and lift prior to launching.  Try adjusting the timing of the release using the “tick-tock” technique.  Second biggest culprit - just not enough stored potential energy.  Have learners turn the propeller until they can see many bumps in the rubber band. \n\n\n2.        It seems that this is for young learners. How can I adapt this project for older students?\nIncorporate the iterative design process using different wing and fuselage designs, as outlined in the Flying Machines Extension document and explore how each iteration impacts flight.  Older learners are all for testing and repeating, instead of one and done!\n\n\n3.        Is this project reusable/extendable?\nYes! By using masking tape to attach different wing designs, learners can iterate on their designs without damaging the core fuselage, enabling a deeper exploration of the engineering design process.  Each learner will keep their flying machine - so it’s a perfect “make-and-take” activity for further playful engineering at home. \n\n\n4.        How do I facilitate the engineering design process in this activity?\nUse the wing evolution worksheet to guide learners through an iterative process: draw a wing design, test it, analyze the results, and make improvements. This allows students to practice critical thinking and refine their flying machines using the EDP.\n\n\nTroubleshooting Tips\n•        If the flying machine flies down instead of up or away, change the direction of rotation - it needs to turn clockwise to fly forward / up!\n•         Ensure the rubber band is wound tightly enough (at least 70 twists, but 100 is better!)\n•        For improved flight, experiment with the “tick-tock” technique to master propeller momentum before full release.\n•        Pro Tip: Remind students to focus on iterative testing and peer feedback.\n\n\nEarly Finisher / Post-Build Exploration\nHave learners experiment with new wing shapes, combining multiple designs to observe different flight patterns. Use prompts like, “What happens if we make the wings larger?” to spark curiosity.  Encourage students to disassemble their flying machines and rebuild them using new designs, emphasizing the iterative nature of engineering.\nReflective / Exit Questions\n\n“What’s the difference between potential energy and kinetic energy?
