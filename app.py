Try adjusting the timing of the release using the “tick-tock” technique.  Second biggest culprit - just not enough stored potential energy.  Have learners turn the propeller until they can see many bumps in the rubber band. \n\n2.\tIt seems that this is for young learners. How can I adapt this project for older students?\nIncorporate the iterative design process using different wing and fuselage designs, as outlined in the Flying Machines Extension document and explore how each iteration impacts flight.  Older learners are all for testing and repeating, instead of one and done!\n\n3.\tIs this project reusable/extendable?\nYes! By using masking tape to attach different wing designs, learners can iterate on their designs without damaging the core fuselage, enabling a deeper exploration of the engineering design process.  Each learner will keep their flying machine - so it’s a perfect “make-and-take” activity for further playful engineering at home. \n\n4.\tHow do I facilitate the engineering design process in this activity?\nUse the wing evolution worksheet to guide learners through an iterative process: draw a wing design, test it, analyze the results, and make improvements. This allows students to practice critical thinking and refine their flying machines using the EDP.\n\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide\nIf the flying machine flies down instead of up or away, change the direction of rotation - it needs to turn clockwise to fly forward / up!\n•\t Ensure the rubber band is wound tightly enough (at least 70 twists, but 100 is better!)\n•\tFor improved flight, experiment with the “tick-tock” technique to master propeller momentum before full release.\n•\tPro Tip: Remind students to focus on iterative testing and peer feedback.\n\n## Early Finisher / Post-Build Exploration\n- Extension Activities\n- Have learners experiment with new wing shapes, combining multiple designs to observe different flight patterns. Use prompts like, “What happens if we make the wings larger?” to spark curiosity.  Encourage students to disassemble their flying machines and rebuild them using new designs, emphasizing the iterative nature of engineering.\n\n\n## Assessment Plan\n### Formative Assessment\n- [Monitoring strategies]\n- [Check-in points]\n\n### Summative Assessment\n- [Final products]\n- [Evaluation criteria]\n\n### Reflective / Exit Questions\n- [Key reflection questions]\n- [Exit ticket prompts]\n- [Self-assessment tools]\n\n## Differentiation Strategies\n### Extensions\n- [Advanced options]\n- Extension guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10yhLicUuuxH9fSAwZoGPZ9gr6zqO4Or2FQ5DKcSmZBQ/edit?tab=t.0\n\n### Support\n- [Scaffolding options]\n\n## Follow-Up\n- [Homework if applicable]\n- [Connection to next lesson]\n\n## Reflection Space\n### Teacher Notes\n- [Areas for observation]\n- [Points for improvement]\n\n## Vocabulary Guide\n### Key Terms\nPropeller\nDefinition: A device with blades that spins to move the flying machine through the air.\nContext: The propeller is powered by the twisted rubber band, which makes the flying machine fly.\n\t\nFuselage\nDefinition: The main body of the flying machine.\nContext: The fuselage holds all the components together and keeps the machine balanced during flight.\n\t\nElastic Potential Energy\nDefinition: The energy stored when a material is stretched or twisted.\nContext: Twisting the rubber band stores elastic potential energy that is released when the propeller spins.\n\t\nKinetic Energy\nDefinition: The energy of motion.\nContext: When the rubber band is released, its stored elastic potential energy turns into kinetic energy, making the flying machine move.\n\t\nWing\nDefinition: The flat surface attached to the fuselage that helps the flying machine lift off the ground\nContext: Learners can design and modify the wings to change how the machine flies.\n\t\nIteration\nDefinition: Repeating a process to improve a design or solution.\nContext: Learners create multiple versions of their flying machine’s wings, testing each one to see which design flies the best.\n\t\nAerodynamics\nDefinition: The study of how air moves around objects.\nContext: The shape and size of the wings affect the aerodynamics of the flying machine, determining how well it flies.\n\t\n\n\n### Visual References\n- slide deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bivSVtEx3jR9vB8cXnLIiewoF4l_Euw3bLI127oXoWA/edit?usp=sharing\n- wing wvolution worksheet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/15mse9UAr--BpgHjzxIilUaKPZyXGuj-RsWysCsAT1Cw/edit?usp=sharing: [Visual aid/diagram]\n```\n\n Example: <h1>Flying Machines Spark: Comprehensive Educator’s Guide</h1><h2>One-Page Quick Start</h2><p><strong>What’s the big idea?</strong> Learners in grades K and up can design and build a wind-up flying machine using stored potential and released kinetic energy. This project takes a minimum of 10 minutes if at an event activity station, 30 minutes in a single classroom session, or up to 60 minutes if you use our recommended extensions. Please refer to the full guide for details.</p><p><strong>What’s in the kit?</strong></p><p>- Propeller<br>- Two craft sticks<br>- A latex-free rubber band<br>- A cardstock rectangle<br>- Sticky strips<br>- An instruction sheet</p><p><strong>Are any extra materials needed?</strong> Yes! Students will need access to scissors and markers to design and create a fuselage for their flying machine. You may want to make additional scrap or construction paper available if they want to make an alternate “wing.”</p><p><strong>How can I lead my students with confidence?</strong> These slide decks prepare you to communicate the big ideas and pro tips for activating the materials.</p><h2>Build Your Confidence - Make a Flying Machine!</h2>
<p>Educators are most confident and successful when they build an example before using it with learners. You’ll need about fifteen minutes to tackle this activity, and those will be minutes that you’ll thank yourself for taking later. By investing in practice, you’ll learn how the project connects to your learning objectives, some challenges to anticipate, and develop your own pro tips to help learners know where to start based on what challenged you.</p>

<p>Here’s a text overview of the build process to help you get started. We encourage you to use the Flying Machines slide deck as well to help with the build process.</p>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<p>1. Gather Materials: Review the Spark components: 2 craft sticks, sticky foam strips, a paper clip, a propeller, a latex-free rubber band, and cardstock. You’ll need to supply scissors and drawing materials.</p>
<p>2. Start with Sticks: Align the craft sticks at the center and secure them using two sticky foam strips. The foam wraps tightly around the overlap to form the main body (fuselage) of the flying machine.</p>
<p>3. Create the Engine Hook: Bend the paper clip into an “L” shape. Attach it to one end of the fuselage using another foam strip. This will serve as the hook for the rubber band, acting as the engine of the flying machine.</p>
<p>4. Attach Your Propeller: On the opposite end of the fuselage, attach the propeller securely. This step forms the flying machine’s propulsion system.</p>
<p>5. Add the Wing: Using the cardstock, encourage learners to draw, cut, and attach a wing to the fuselage. Highlight that larger wings might add weight, affecting flight. Pro Tip: Test different wing shapes and sizes to explore aerodynamics.</p>
<p>6. Connect the Rubber Band: Hook one end of the rubber band to the paper clip and the other to the small hook on the propeller. This can be challenging, so encourage patience. Pro Tip: Twist the propeller clockwise multiple times to tighten the rubber band, storing elastic potential energy. You may need to review the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise.</p>
<p>7. Prepare for Launch: Demonstrate the “tick-tock technique” to allow the propeller to generate momentum and lift prior to launching your flying machine. With one hand on the propeller and the other holding near the paperclip, release the propeller (“tick”) to let it spin briefly, then lightly launch the fuselage (“tock”).</p>
<p>8. Test and Iterate: Have learners test their flying machines in a safe, open area. Encourage them to tweak wing shapes, sizes, and the number of rubber band twists to observe different flight outcomes. Use our Flying Machines Extension document and its printable wing evolution worksheet to support the testing and iteration.</p>

<h2>Facilitate With Confidence</h2>
<h3>Classroom Planning</h3>
<p>This is a 30-minute activity and can be extended with the use of our extension plan. Organize your workspaces with access to additional paper, tape, scissors, and drawing materials if possible. Encourage experimentation by supplying extra cardstock for wing modifications.</p>

<h3>Facilitation Tips</h3>
<p>Reinforce the importance of letting learners take ownership of their designs, offering support without leading. Use open-ended questions to guide learners through troubleshooting, fostering a student-centered, inquiry-driven environment.</p>
<p>- Promote student-led inquiry: ask learners how they might modify their wings for better flight or what changes to the rubber band tension could do.</p>
<p>- Teach SEL skills by emphasizing perseverance and teamwork, especially during the “tick-tock” testing phase.</p>

This allows students to practice critical thinking and refine their flying machines using the EDP.</p><h3>Reflection and Assessment</h3>
<p>Encourage learners to reflect on their designs and the iterations they made during the activity. Ask open-ended questions such as:</p>
<p>- What changes did you make to improve your flying machine?</p>
<p>- How did your understanding of potential and kinetic energy influence your design?</p>
<p>- If you had more time, what would you try next?</p>

<h2>Extensions and Enrichment</h2>
<p><strong>Connect to STEM Concepts:</strong></p>
<p>- Explore how wing shapes influence flight by researching real-world examples like bird wings and airplane designs.</p>
<p>- Experiment with different materials for wings to understand how weight and stiffness impact flight performance.</p>
<p>- Dive deeper into energy transfer by measuring how many twists of the rubber band are optimal for flight distance or height.</p>
